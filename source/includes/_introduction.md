# Introduction

Welcome to the Dwolla API V2 documentation, currently in active development. Gradually, the functionality of API V1 will be implemented in API V2.  The two versions will operate in parallel for the foreseeable future.

The initial focus of API Version 2 centers around a premium feature: [White Label](https://www.dwolla.com/white-label), and will not provide the same functionality as Version 1 does.  Over time, we will add the same functionality currently currently available in V1 to V2.

Official SDKs for Java, Node.JS, PHP, Ruby, and Python are being actively developed.

It is important to note: White Label is a premium feature that cannot be activated in our production environment until youâ€™ve received our approval to use it and have entered into an agreement with us. Feel free to [contact a sales representative](https://www.dwolla.com/contact?b=apidocs) to find the package that best suits your needs.

## Making Requests

```shell
POST https://api.dwolla.com/customers
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/vnd.dwolla.v1.hal+json
Authorization: Bearer myOAuthAccessToken123

{
	"foo": "bar"
}
```

```shell
...

GET https://www.dwolla.com/oauth/rest/transactions?client_id=XYZ&client_secret=JJJ&limit=10
```

All requests should supply the `Accept: application/vnd.dwolla.v1.hal+json` header. `POST` requests must have a JSON encoded body and the `Content-Type: application/vnd.dwolla.v1.hal+json` header.

Requests must be made over HTTPS.  Any non-secure requests are met with a redirect (HTTP 302) to the HTTPS equivalent URI.

### Authorization

Request and response bodies are JSON encoded.

All requests require either an OAuth access token or a `client_id` and `client_secret`.  OAuth access tokens are passed via the `Authorization` HTTP header:

`Authorization: Bearer {access_token_here}`

Requests that require an client_id and client_secret are passed in the JSON request body for `POST` requests or as querystring parameters for `GET` requests:

`GET https://api.dwolla.com/example?client_id={client_id}&client_secret={client_secret}`

### API Host
**Production:** https://api.dwolla.com

**Sandbox:** https://api-uat.dwolla.com


## Errors

### Example error.  HTTP 401:

```shell
{
  "code": "InvalidCredentials",
  "description": "Invalid access token."
}
```


Error responses use HTTP status codes to indicate the type of error.  The JSON response body will contain an error code and a description of the error.


### Common Errors
The following errors are common across all API endpoints.

| HTTP Status | Error Code | Description

Relationships and available actions for a resource are represented with links.  All resources have a `_links` attribute.  At a minimum, all resources will have a `self` link which indicates the URL of the resource itself.

Some links, such as `funding-sources`, give you a URL which you can follow to access related resources.  For example, the customer resource has a `funding-sources` link which, when followed, will list the customer's available funding sources.

Responses which contain a collection of resources have pagination links, `first`, `next`, `last`, and `prev`.

Other links represent actions which can be done with the resource.  For instance, customers which are eligible to send funds have a `send` link which directs you to the [transfer](#initiate-transfer) endpoint.

Dwolla's API lets you interact with a user's Dwolla account and act on its behalf to send money, request money, and more.  To do so, your application first needs to request authorization from users.  

Dwolla implements the [OAuth 2.0 standard](http://oauth.net/2/) to facilitate this authorization. Similar to Facebook and Twitter's authentication flow, the user is first presented with a permission dialog for your application, at which point the user can either approve the permissions requested, or reject them. Once the user approves, an `authorization_code` is sent to your application, which will then [be exchanged](#finish-authorization) for an `access_token` and a `refresh_token` pair. 

The `access_token` can then be used to make API calls which require user authentication like [Send](#send-money) or [List Transactions](#list-a-user's-transactions). 

### Token lifetimes

**Access tokens** are *short lived*: 1 hour.

**Refresh tokens** are *long lived*: 60 days.

A refresh token can be used within 60 days to generate a new access_token and refresh_token pair.  So long as you [refresh your authorization](#refresh-authorization) at least every 60 days, your application can maintain authorization indefinitely without requiring the user to re-authorize.

## Request Authorization

```php
<?php

$OAuth = new Dwolla\OAuth();
$OAuth->settings->client_id = $apiKey;
$OAuth->settings->client_secret = $apiSecret;

$url = $OAuth->genAuthUrl("https://myredirect.com/redirect");

?>
```
```python
# Generate OAuth URL with redirect to requestb.in
print(oauth.genauthurl("http://requestb.in/122rdhc1"))
```
```js
// where to send the user after they grant permission:
var redirect_uri = "https://www.myredirect.com/redirect";  

// generate OAuth initiation URL
var authUrl = Dwolla.authUrl(redirect_uri);
```

```ruby
redirect_uri = "https://www.myredirect.com/redirect"
authUrl = Dwolla::OAuth.get_auth_url(redirect_uri)
```

> Example initiation URL (send the user there):

```shell
https://uat.dwolla.com/oauth/v2/authenticate?client_id=PO%2BSzGAsZCE4BTG7Cw4OAL40Tpf1008mDjGBSVo6QLNfM4mD%2Ba&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://developers.dwolla.com/dev/token/callback?env=sandbox&scope=Balance%7CAccountInfoFull
```

To start the OAuth process, construct the initiation URL which the user will visit in order to grant permission to your application.  It describes the permissions your application requires (`scope`), who the client application is (`client_id`), and where the user should be redirected to after they grant or deny permissions to your application (`redirect_uri`).


### URL Format:

`
https://www.dwolla.com/oauth/v2/authenticate?client_id={client_id}&response_type=code&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&scope={scope}
`


Parameter | Optional |Description
----------|----------|------------
client_id | | Application key
response_type | | This must always be set to `code`
redirect_uri | | URL where the user will be redirected to afterwards
scope | | Permissions you are requesting.  See [below](#oauth-scopes) for list of available scopes.  Scopes are delimited by a pipe ("&#124;")
verified_account | yes | Require new users opting to register for Dwolla to create a fully-verified Dwolla account instead of a default lightweight Direct account.

Remember to url-encode all querystring parameters!

### OAuth Scopes

Applications may request the following permission scopes when generating an access token:

Scope Name | Description
-----------|-------------
AccountInfoFull | Access detailed account profile
Contacts | Access the user's contacts
Transactions | Access the user's transaction data
Balance | Access the user's Dwolla account balance
Send | Send money on the user's behalf
Request | Send money requests, list them, fulfill them
Funding | Access the user's funding sources (i.e. connected bank accounts)
ManageAccount | Manage the user's account settings
Scheduled | Allow scheduling one-time and recurring payments.
ManageCustomers | Includes create customer records, manage their funding sources, and allow related money movement

## Finish Authorization

```json
{
  "client_id": "JCGQXLrlfuOqdUYdTcLz3rBiCZQDRvdWIUPkw++GMuGhkem9Bo",
  "client_secret": "g7QLwvO37aN2HoKx1amekWi8a2g7AIuPbD5C/JSLqXIcDOxfTr",
  "code": "h6TvQZH+5BsV//O43uOJ0uRkBLk=",
  "grant_type": "authorization_code",
  "redirect_uri": "https://www.myredirect.com/redirect"
}
```

> Successful Response:

```shell
{
  "access_token": "4Qu79qhO5GkPwo4fsbuc9ve4mJKN/XnxcT34F812y6SBIyGrnP",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "mRRYs+CXrwe67kIDa1XFIiZJsEzUEbMerrU3zlmFSqo51obG3d",
  "refresh_expires_in": 5183765,
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "scope": "balance|accountinfofull|send|request|transactions|contacts|funding|manageaccount|scheduled|managecustomers"
}
```

Once the user returns to your application via the `redirect_uri` you specified, there will be a `code` querystring parameter appended to that URL.  Exchange the authorization `code` for an `access_token` and `refresh_token` pair.

### HTTP Request
`POST https://www.dwolla.com/oauth/v2/token`

Parameter | Description
----------|------------
client_id | Application key
client_secret | Application secret

grant_type | This must be set to `authorization_code`
redirect_uri | The same redirect_uri specified in the intiation step

### Response Parameters

Parameter | Description
----------|------------
access_token | A new access token with requested scopes
expires_in | The lifetime of the access token, in seconds.  Default is 3600.
refresh_token | New refresh token
refresh_expires_in | The lifetime of the refresh token, in seconds.  Default is 5184000.
token_type | Always `bearer`.
scope | Pipe (`|`) delimited list of permission scopes granted

## Refresh Authorization
```json
{
  "client_id": "JCGQXLrlfuOqdUYdTcLz3rBiCZQDRvdWIUPkw++GMuGhkem9Bo",
  "client_secret": "g7QLwvO37aN2HoKx1amekWi8a2g7AIuPbD5C/JSLqXIcDOxfTr",
  "refresh_token": "Pgk+l9okjwTCfsvIvEDPrsomE1er1txeyoaAkTIBAuXza8WvZY",
  "grant_type": "refresh_token"
}
```

> Successful Response:

```shell
{
  "access_token": "4Qu79qhO5GkPwo4fsbuc9ve4mJKN/XnxcT34F812y6SBIyGrnP",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "mRRYs+CXrwe67kIDa1XFIiZJsEzUEbMerrU3zlmFSqo51obG3d",
  "refresh_expires_in": 5184000,
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "scope": "balance|accountinfofull|send|request|transactions|contacts|funding|manageaccount|scheduled|managecustomers"
}
```

> Invalid or Expired Refresh Token Response:

```shell
{
  "error": "access_denied",
  "error_description": "Invalid refresh token."
}
{
  "error": "access_denied",
  "error_description": "Expired refresh token."
}
```

Use a valid `refresh_token` to generate a new `access_token` and `refresh_token` pair.

**NOTE:** The `refresh_token` you receive will *change* every time you exchange either an `authorization_code` or `refresh_token` for a new token pair. Only the most recently issued `refresh_token` will allow you to receive a new pair.

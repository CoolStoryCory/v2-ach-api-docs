# Events

An event is created to notify you that an action occured on your account. When a unique event occurs(e.g. customer_created), we create a new event object. A single API request can create multiple events. For example, if you initiate a transfer from an Account to a Customer then events can be created for `transfer_created` and `transfer_completed`.
